- OpenTravel Hotel Schema Disability Audit Results: An OpenTravel Hotel Disability Project Brief artifact has been included with the OpenTravel 2011B 1.0 XML Schema Message publication. The OpenTravel Hotel Disability project was focused on a subset of the new 2010 ADA legislation that specifically applies to electronic hotel reservations and includes identifying and describing accessible features; reserving, upon request, accessible guest rooms or specific types of guest rooms and ensuring that the guest rooms requested are blocked and removed from all reservations systems; and guaranteeing the specific accessible guest room. Per the audit results, relatively few changes were made to OpenTravel Hotel schema, with one change made to one common hotel schema (OTA_HotelCommonTypes) to provide a more consistent and structured way to pass measurement information, and annotation changes made to three hotel schema (OTA_HotelCommonTypes, OTA_RailCommonTypes and OTA_RailPreferences) to accommodate renaming the OpenTravel Code List Physically Challenged Feature code table. The slide show included with the publication includes an overview of the project.
